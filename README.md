# SequenceAlignmentTool
This tool compares four different DNA sequences with another given DNA sequence. For each sequence it checks all of its mutants and all of its offsets and then it gives the best result it finds. The comparison is made in parallel in C language (over Linux) using MPI and OpenMP libraries
